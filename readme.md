caution please!!!
1. you should create a symbolic link from public/storage to storage/app/public.
2. sometimes, your wechat rediret_url method will be modified according to your server configuration.	
3. if the protocol is https, we should change http://res.wx.qq.com/open/js/jweixin-1.0.0.js to https://res.wx.qq.com/open/js/jweixin-1.0.0.js
   and so does cnzz script.
